To recognize speech in a different language, set the language keyword argument of the recognize_*() method to a string corresponding to the desired language. Most of the methods accept a BCP-47 language tag, such as 'en-US' for American English, or 'fr-FR' for French. For example, the following recognizes French speech in an audio file:

import speech_recognition as sr

r = sr.Recognizer()

with sr.AudioFile('path/to/audiofile.wav') as source:
    audio = r.record(source)

r.recognize_google(audio, language='fr-FR')
Only the following methods accept a language keyword argument:

recognize_bing()
recognize_google()
recognize_google_cloud()
recognize_ibm()
recognize_sphinx()
